# VTM5_probability_calculator

I recently decided to update an old python script I had done to visualize and understand better the probabilities of *Vampire : The Masquerade* 5th edition.

I will maybe make an html interface with a simple calculator and charts to make it easier to use. For the moment, only csv writing and *matplotlib.pyplot* is available.
